### Model Selection Strategy

The solution uses a **two-tier model architecture** for optimal performance and cost efficiency:

| Component | Model | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Central Agent** | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Deep reasoning for complex orchestration and decision-making |
| **Quality Inspector** | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Advanced evaluation capabilities for multi-criteria assessment |
| **Query Expansion** | Claude Haiku 4.5 | Fast, cost-efficient query reformulation |
| **Query Decomposition** | Claude Haiku 4.5 | Quick sub-query generation |
| **Response Generation** | Claude Haiku 4.5 | Balanced speed and quality for answer generation |

This architecture ensures **high-quality reasoning where it matters most** (orchestration and quality checks) while maintaining **speed and cost efficiency** for operational tasks (retrieval strategies and generation).

## 🔄 How It Works

### Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Query Ingestion**
   - User submits a natural language question
   - Central agent (Sonnet 4.5) receives and analyzes the query

2. **Context Retrieval**
   - System retrieves relevant documents from DynamoDB
   - Relevance checking filters low-quality context
   - If context is insufficient, triggers query refinement

3. **Strategy Selection**
   - Agent (Haiku 4.5) selects optimal retrieval strategy:
     - **Simple queries** → Direct retrieval
     - **Broad queries** → Query expansion
     - **Complex queries** → Query decomposition
     - **Multi-faceted queries** → Combined approach

4. **Response Generation**
   - LLM (Haiku 4.5) generates initial response using retrieved context
   - Incorporates citations and source references

5. **Quality Evaluation**
   - Quality inspector (Sonnet 4.5) performs automated assessment on three dimensions:
     - **Relevance Score**: Alignment with user intent
     - **Completeness Score**: Coverage of query aspects
     - **Accuracy Score**: Factual grounding in your source documents. **Self-Correction Decision**
   - **If quality is good** → Return response to user (Done)
   - **If quality is poor and attempts < 3**:
     - Analyze failure points
     - Retrieve additional context if needed
     - Adjust generation strategy
     - Regenerate response
     - Loop back to quality check
   - **If attempts ≥ 3** → Return best available response with disclaimer

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **AWS Account** with appropriate permissions for:
  - Amazon Bedrock
  - Amazon DynamoDB
  - AWS Lambda (if using serverless deployment)
- **Python 3.8+**
- **AWS CLI** configured with credentials
- **Amazon Bedrock Model Access** enabled for:
  - **Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5** (required for Central Agent and Quality Inspector)
  - **Anthropic Claude Haiku 4.5** (required for sub-agents)

## 🚀 Installation

  - **Anthropic Claude Haiku 4.5**

## 💻 Usage

This solution is implemented as a **Jupyter notebook** that demonstrates the complete self-corrective agentic RAG workflow. There is no pre-built function or class to import - instead, you'll work through the notebook cells to understand and execute each component.

### Running the Notebook

1. **Start Jupyter**:
```bash
jupyter notebook 01-setup-create-insert-dynamodb.ipynb
jupyter notebook 02-self-corrective-agentic-rag.ipynb
```

2. **Execute cells sequentially** to:
   - Initialize AWS Bedrock clients for Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Haiku 4.5
   - Set up DynamoDB connections
   - Configure the central agent and sub-agents
   - Define quality evaluation criteria
   - Run example queries through the self-corrective workflow

3. **The notebook demonstrates**:
   - Complete workflow execution with detailed logging
   - Query examples with different strategies (expansion, decomposition, combined)
   - Visualization of correction iterations
   - Performance metrics and quality scores
   - Comparison between standard RAG and self-corrective RAG

### Example Workflow in Notebook

The notebook includes cells that show:

```python
# Initialize Bedrock clients
import boto3

bedrock_runtime = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime', region_name='us-east-1')

# Configure models
CENTRAL_AGENT_MODEL = "anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-v2:0"  # Deep reasoning
QUALITY_INSPECTOR_MODEL = "anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-v2:0"  # Quality assessment
SUB_AGENT_MODEL = "anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-v2:0"  # Fast operations

# Execute a query through the self-corrective workflow
user_query = "What are the main business segments of Octank Financial?"

# The notebook walks through each step:
# 1. Central agent processes query
# 2. Context retrieval from DynamoDB
# 3. Strategy selection (expansion/decomposition/combined)
# 4. Response generation
# 5. Quality evaluation
# 6. Iterative improvement (if needed)
# 7. Final response with metrics
```

### Example Queries Demonstrated

**Simple Query:**
```python
query = "What is the fair value of HTM portfolio?"
# Strategy: Direct retrieval
# Model: Haiku 4.5
# Expected attempts: 1
```

**Complex Query:**
```python
query = "What is octank tower and how does the whistleblower scandal hurt the company and its image?"
# Strategy: Combined (expansion + decomposition)
# Models: Haiku 4.5 (generation) + Sonnet 4.5 (quality check)
# Expected attempts: 2-3
```
